# [Find the odd int](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54da5a58ea159efa38000836)

Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times. <br><br>

Examples

<code>[7]</code> should return <code>7</code>, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).

<code>[0]</code> should return <code>0</code>, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).

<code>[1,1,2]</code> should return <code>2</code>, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).

<code>[0,1,0,1,0]</code> should return <code>0</code>, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).

<code>[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1]</code> should return <code>4</code>, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).
