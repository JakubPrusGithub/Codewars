# [CamelCase Method](https://www.codewars.com/kata/587731fda577b3d1b0001196/swift)

Write a simple <code>camelCase</code> function for strings. All words must have their first letter capitalized and all spaces removed.

For instance:
<pre>
camelCase("hello case"); // ==> "HelloCase"
camelCase("camel case word"); // ==> "CamelCaseWord"
</pre>
